## Introduction
As a data engineer you need to provide master data for our downstream users Business Intelligence,
Machine Learning, Experimentation and Marketing. These teams will use the data for multiple purposes, the tables
and data model youâ€™ll create should help them answer relevant questions.

The repository uses the information in [this url](https://github.com/IMARVI/sr_de_challenge) to fetch the required information, transform it, and save it in CSV format that will help us create tables that will answer the questions needed for the business needs. 

## Requirements
All the dependencies for this project are in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
The project includes a script that processes the raw information and creates the necessary CSV files for table creation.

This script performs the ETL tasks for Challenge 2. It will save six CSV files. You can run it using the following command:
    ```bash
    python master_tables.py
